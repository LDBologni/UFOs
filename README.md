# UFOs

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the challenge is to use JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to create an interactive webpage, where users can see and filter data regarding UFO sightings. Dana has a JavaScript array of great data showing different aspects of many UFO sightings around North America. She would like to give the users a better experience by allowing them to filter the data on any or all five different variables; Date, City, State, Country, or Shape.

## Results

Dana's website has a great, and starts to get an eye catching and professional HTML page. She asked us to add multiple criteria filters for her audience to slice the data across different variables. By using the JavasScript the information added is filtered by the following criterias City, State, Country, and Shape to filter the data by. The information can be filtered without a clickable button and simply filter the moment that an information is entered and is recognized.
